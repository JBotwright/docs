Isambard User Documentation
===========================

Isambard is a HPC service provided by `GW4 <http://gw4.ac.uk>`_ and the `UK Met Office <https://www.metoffice.gov.uk>`_.
The system is funded by `EPSRC <http://www.epsrc.ac.uk>`_ and is one of six Tier-2 HPC facilities in the UK.

Isambard is a Cray XC50 system which comprises 10,496 cores, and is one of the worlds first production Arm-based supercomputers.
Each of the 164 compute nodes contains two 32-core Cavium ThunderX2 processors running at 2.1 GHz, and has 256 GB of DDR4-2666 memory.
The nodes are connected via Cray Aries interconnect with a Dragonfly topology.
A Cray Sonexion 3000 storage cabinet provides 480 terabytes of Lustre storage.


System Status

.. important::
    14 Sept 2020
    
    Dear users,
    
    Weâ€™re delighted to be able to announce that the long-awaited upgrade to Isambard will take place next week, starting on Monday September 21st. The upgrade is likely to take most of the week, and we anticipate that the system will be down for most of this time. 
    
    Once the system is back up as Isambard 2, it will have twice the capacity in its XC50 Arm partition (up from 164 to 328 compute nodes, or 20,992 cores), as well as a doubling of storage capacity to 1 PByte. At the same time, the 72 Fujitsu A64FX nodes will be installed as a new Apollo 80 system.
    
    We will keep you informed as to progress, but do keep in mind that Isambard is likely to be unavailable for most of the week of Sep 21st during these upgrades.
